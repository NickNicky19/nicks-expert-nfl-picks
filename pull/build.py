"""Build this week's props, PPR projections and Top Overs/Unders into output/data/.

Run: python pull/build.py

Lines are self-generated (no paid odds): each player's per-game baseline, rounded to x.5. The projection is
Sleeper's (RotoWire) projected stat line. A lean is the projection against the line. Everything about a player's
history uses only weeks strictly before this one, so a line never sees the game it is for.
